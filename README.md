### 1. Highlights

<li> Feature attribution explains CNNs in terms of the input pixels.
<li> The abstraction of feature attribution to higher level impacting factors is hard.
<li> Concept attribution explains CNNs with high-level concepts such as clinical factors.
<li> Nuclei pleomorphism is shown as a relevant factor in breast tumor classification.
<li> Concept attribution can match clinical expectations to the interpretability of CNNs.

#### 2. Usage

With this library you will be able to apply concept attribution to your task.
The main steps are:
1. Extraction of concept measures
2. Finding the vector representing the concept in the activation space
3. Generating concept-based explanations

##### 2.1. Extract basic concepts
Color and texture measures can be extracted from the images in your data to be represented as concepts.
See the functions:
<li> get_color_measure(image, mask=None, type=None, verbose=True)
<li> get_texture_measure(image, mask=None, type=None, verbose=True)

##### 2.2 Find the concept vectors
We compute RCVs by least squares linear regression of the concept measures for a set of inputs. The concept vector (RCV) represents the direction of greatest increase of the measures for a single continuous concept. Different parameters can be specified to compute the regression:  
 1. compute linear regression  
 2. compute ridge regression
 3. compute local linear regression -- not yet supported

 See the functions:
 <li> get_activations(model, layer, data, labels=None, pooling=None, param_update=False, save_fold='')
 <li> linear_regression(acts, measures, type='linear', evaluation=False, verbose=True)

#### 3. Evaluation

 The regression is evaluated in different ways:
  1. on training or held-out data, with rsquared, mse and adjusted rsquared
  2. by evaluating angle between two RCVs

 See the functions:
 <li> mse(labels, predictions)
 <li> rsquared(labels, predictions)
